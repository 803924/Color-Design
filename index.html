                <h1>Why are Good Color Schemes So Important?</h1>
                <br>
                <p>You probably know already that adding good color to anything is very important,
                but do you know just how big of an impact it can have on websites and other objects?
                Color design starts off by choosing a color palette that fits the mood of your website.
                The image shown below uses the colors I tried to use in this web page. It's supposed to convey 
                energy, optimism and, at the same time, harmony and growth.</p>
                <p class="credit">Thanks to this website for providing a lot of this infromation:
                <a href="https://visme.co/blog/website-color-schemes/">Visme</a></p>
                <img src="https://visme.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/website50-1024x512.jpg">
                <p class="credit">image from <a href="http://www.qedgroup.cz/en/">QED Group</a> and
                <a href="https://visme.co/blog/website-color-schemes/">visme.</a></p>
                <br>
                <p>There are a ton of studies that show just how big of an impact color can have on websites.
                Studies suggest that people make subconscious decisions judgment about a product within 90 seconds
                of initial viewing, and up too 90% of that judgment comes from just color alone.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Not only can color help make websites more memorable and provoke emotion, it can also help the user
                navigate through the website. Using strong colors on key information can draw more attention and create 
                calls to action. Another study shows strong evidence supporting this claim. Take HubSpot as an
                example. A while ago, they publicly shared their results of a test they carried out looking at the
                impact of color theory. They had two pages that were identical to one another except for the call to
                action button. One had a red button whilst the other had a green button. with over 2,000 visits to
                These pages, The green button attracted 21% more clicks than the red button.</p>
                <br>
                <p>One other thing you may have not known was that color plays a role in Accessibility. With 
                approximately 8% of men and 0.5% of women affected by some form of color blindness, using 
                colors with high value of contrast is key to making sure everyone can read your content.</p>
